Are you good at doing Math? Like,really good at it? Know how to code in Python and R and have a really deep knowledge,understanding of industry?

Then why work as a coder or statistician for some outdated government agency when you can get top-dollar for being Data Scientist.LinkedIn just [voted] the hottest skill that got people hired this year as 'Statistical Analysis And Data Mining.'

Many people in the technology industry say that Data Science field is already in a bubble.Though,no signs of downturn have been observed as of now.It is growing exponentially with Data Science and related field's grads are almost fully abosrbed as soon as they graduate.

Why the unexpected surge?It is observed that Google,Amazon,Netflix and Uber already have Data Science teams surprisingly non-tech companies like Walmart also have started building Data Science teams.The real reason for this surge seems practically clear- Need of professionals with Deep Analytical skills who with Data can predict the future of company's decisions today.

One more reason may lie in the nature of Data Scienctist's job.It is a job for which going to college for attaining specific skillset is not necessary.Lots of MOOCs(Massively Open Online Courses) are helping people with varied skills to become one.It is often observed that a fast learner goes farther in the field than an expert.Generic programming skills go in a long way as Languages may become obsolete and new ones become popular.

###Just tell me is it for me then?
If you can spend the whole day  coding and anaylsing numbers and probably you are kind of a Data freak who wants to improve the world with Data driven future then its for you.
