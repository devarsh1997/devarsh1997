#On Economies And Disceconomies of Scale

##Economies of Scale
Adam Smith in landmark book ***Wealth of Nations*** identified the di-vision of labor and specialization as the two key means to achieve a larger return on production.<!-- more --> Through these two techniques, employees would not only be able to concentrate on a specific task, but with time, improve the skills necessary to  perform their jobs. The tasks could then be performed better and faster. Hence, through such efficiency, time and money could be saved while production levels increased.

Thus,when more units of a good or a service can be produced on a larger scale, yet with (on average) less input costs, *economies of scale* (ES) are said to be achieved. Alternatively, this means that as a company grows and production units increase, a company will have a better chance to decrease its costs.

####Distinction Between Internal and External ES


Alfred Marshall made a distinction between internal and external economies of scale. When a company decreases its costs and increases it total production, internal economies of scale have been achieved. External economies of scale occur outside of a firm(but within an industry). Say for an example when an industry's scope of operations expands due to the creation of a better transportation network, resulting in a subsequent decrease in cost for a company working within that industry, external economies of scale are said to have been achieved. 

##Diseconomies of Scale 

 Diseconomies of Scale could stem from inefficient labor, over-hiring or worsening transportation networks (external DS). Furthermore, as a company's scope increases, it may have to distribute its goods and services in progressively more dispersed areas. This can actually increase average costs resulting in diseconomies of scale.
 
##Why do they matter?
 First foremost because Economies of scale is a Barrier of Entry to the market for the start-ups.Secondly it also has a physical and engineering basis.For example it
 is sometimes more economical to produce larger amount of chemicals in a chemical industry and there is also a law known as Square-Cube Law(click link for more details) which has a direct effect on the capital cost of such things as buildings, factories, pipelines, ships and airplanes.Lastly, economies of scale also impact the golablised world therefore many people even protest outside WTO meetings against having economies of scale as advent of transnational corporations affect the economies and business environments in developing nations negatively.Thus they matter a lot,
